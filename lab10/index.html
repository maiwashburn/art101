                <h2>CHALLENGES</h2> 
                <p>For some reason, this lab was particularily difficult for me becuase I followed exactly what the professor wrote for their code, 
                    and yet I could not get my buttons to work.
                </p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
                <p>I asked wesbot as well as my partner for help, and tried rewritting my code as well as trying different ways to make the button to work, but I was not able to figure out the problem.

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
                <p>I'm frustrated I wasnt able to get the button to work, but I'm hoping I'll be able to go back and rework this lab. </p>

                <h2>RESULTS</h2>
