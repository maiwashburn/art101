                <h2>CHALLENGES</h2> 
                <p>For some reason, this lab was particularily difficult for me becuase I followed exactly what the professor wrote for their code, 
                    and yet I could not get my buttons to work.</p>
                    EDIT:
                <p>I was able to get this lab to correctly print after debugging, and there were no challenges. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
                <p>I asked wesbot as well as my partner for help, and tried rewritting my code as well as trying different ways to make the button to work, but I was not able to figure out the problem. 
                    </p>
                <p>EDIT: The main problem was that I added an extra comma in my code, making it not print to my website.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
                <p>I'm frustrated I wasnt able to get the button to work, but I'm hoping I'll be able to go back and rework this lab. </p>
                <p>EDIT: I'm proud I was able to find the problem.</p>
