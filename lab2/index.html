					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>For Lab 2, my partner and I found that the most difficult challenges were simple errors found within the code, such as a missing semi-colon,
					or mislabeling a tag name or function. We also saw that there were very simple errors, so to solve this we worked together and compared our code in HTML.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For this lab we coded together, but customized our own websites by changing the colors, so our code is the same, however the 
					colors and designs are a bit different. One problem we ran across was that on Maia's code, the colors would change despite our CSS code being the same. 
					In order to change this, they recoppied the code from Lab 3, as there was a small error within my Lab 2 html code that created this error.
					 </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? 
					This assignment was enjoyable, and while we were learning how to code and ran into simple yet confusing problems, we were able to problem solve and fiz the eorrors within the code fairly quickly. 
					We put in a decent amount of effort into this Lab, working together, asking questions about our code if there were any problems. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> We are satisfied with our results of this lab, and while we could have added more design elements to individualize the website, we experimented multiple times with how to create different styles and looks, which helped us to learn how to code in these new languages. </p>
