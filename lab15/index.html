                <h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
                <p>I had some trouble getting the code to work, specificaly the ajax code that we learned in class, as I wrote it correctly but it wouldn't print, as I missed a step.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
                <p>In order to fix this problem I went back to the simple code that we wrote from the examples in the beginning of the lecture. This worked, however the gif won't change to another image. </p>
