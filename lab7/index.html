                <p>I had a bit of a challenge at first correctly getting the files to work for Lab 7

                <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
                <p>Looking back on this assignment, I wish I figured out how to rearrange the name to be more than just one word. However I ran 
                    out of time to do this and figure out how to code these specific restraits.
