                <h2>CHALLENGES</h2> 
                <p>Wow, we ran into some problems with this assignment. There were multiple challenges, first off I could not figure out 
                    how to make the buttons show up on my HTML. Later, I was not able to make the button change anything, despite putting the correct code 
                    in my css and javascript.
                </p>

            <div id="problem">
                <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
                <p>Problems I ran into were that I incorrectly made a div id for each section,
                    so the buttons would not show up on my sight. I also ran into some issues with 
                    getting the click listener to work, becuase whenever I clicked the button nothing changed. 
                    I tried multiple times to match the same code as Wes wrote in css and javascript, however after
                    looking sollutions to this problem on wedbot and online, i decided to alter the CSS
                    code directly on my javascript code.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="reflection">
                <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
                <p>I am happy that I was able to get the button to change to certain things after I pressed it, however
                    I wish I was able to get the '.special' in my css to work and correctly and link 
                    to my javascript: this method did not work, so I decided to write my code differently. I'm happy this worked, but I am 
                    planning on going back and trying to troubleshoot what exactly went wrong.
