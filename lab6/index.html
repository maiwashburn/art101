					<h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
					<p>One challege I ran into was getting the code to show up on the website. I also had trouble with correctly writing the variables, arrays, and objects at first.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
					<p>The problems that arose were that I could not correctly link my javascript code to my HTML. In order to fix this,
						I looked over my code, and realized in the function for calculating the year, I put an equals "=" instead of minus "-". 
						I also found myself running into errors on the javascript console as I was trying to get used to writing for code. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>REFLECTION</h2>
					<p>This assignment appeared easy to me at first, however I ran into the issue of mistyping my code, which game me an error. However I was able to fix this error, and get everything to work smoothly, which I am proud of.  </p>
