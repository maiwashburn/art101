			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variable</h1>

			<p>Here are the variables I wrote in the Javascript Console on Chrome: </p>
			<p><img class= "console" src="img/javascriptconsole.jpg" width=600px/></p>
			<p>JavaScript Files: </p>
			<p><img class= "javascript" src="img/javascriptfile.jpg" width=600px/></p>
			<p>HTML Source Code:</p>
			<p><img class= "sourcec code" src="img/htmlsourcecode.jpg" width=600px/></p>
			<p>Webpage:</p>
			<p><img class= "Webpage" src="img/lab5webpage.jpg" width=600px/></p>

					<h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
					<p>For lab 5, the only challenges I ran into were that I had a bit of trouble figuring out
						the right order and way of creating variables in the JavaScript console. I also was getting
						used to the specific way to write in JavaScript, as it's a new language for me
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
					<p>One problem that I ran into was that I could not correctly link my JavaScript code to this HTML code, and 
						my JavaScript code would not show up on the website - the problem I found was that I added an extra letter 
					after the semicolon, making the code technically unreadable/incorrect. After I deleted this extra letter,
					my code worked and everything that I wanted to appear on the website was visible. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>REFLECTION</h2>
					<p>This assignment was very informative for me, as it taught me how to create variables and lists using JavaScript - I also
						was proud that I could trouble-shoot problems, and fix these probelms as well. If i had any questions, I'd reach out to my lab 
					partner, we also went over the lab together before we started, and asked each other any questions we had, which 
					in turn helped me to work and finish the assignment.  </p>

					<h2>RESULTS</h2>
