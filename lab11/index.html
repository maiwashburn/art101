                <h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
                <p>I found there to be many difficulties with this lab, however it was very hard for me to discern what the problems were. </p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
                <p>I had trouble finding what the problem was at first, becuase my code was exactly the same as my partners and 
                    the Professors code. I ended up rewriting the links and script sources in the head of the HTML code, and this 
                    seemed to make things work finally. I spent a few hours troubleshooting and asking my partner for help, but I was able to solve the problem.
